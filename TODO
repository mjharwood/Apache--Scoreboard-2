scripts under examples/ need to be updated to 2.0

lib/Apache/ScoreboardGraph.pm needs to be ported

modperl's xs/typemap while includes the conversions for certain types
it doesn't include the typemap declaration, so XS extensions have to
add things like:

Apache::RequestRec	        T_APACHEOBJ
APR::Pool                       T_PTROBJ

to the local typemap file. Would be nice if mod_perl had these
declared already in its typemap.
