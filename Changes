2.05 -

added new methods $image->thread_limit and $image->server_limit and
deprecated the Apache::Const::SERVER_LIMIT and
Apache::Const::THREAD_LIMIT constants, since those are useful only for
the image of the Apache server inside which the script is run (if
any).

use the passed image object, rather than accessing the global
ap_scoreboard_image. Previously we have switched to use Apache
accessors, instead of accessing the struct directly, but the problem
was that we no longer processed the real image object. So if the
script has acquired a different image (not the one seen by the current
process), we were handing bogus information. Now this has been fixed
by copying the apache accessors and changing them to use the passed
image.

in thaw() replace the usage of memmove with apr_pmemdup, since objects
created by the pool, can't mix memmove with apr pool allocation (found
this problem after apr was compiled with CPPFLAGS="-DAPR_BUCKET_DEBUG"
--enable-pool-debug, were getting segfaults when the pool was
destroyed)
